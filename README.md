## How It Works 
Reads the [Schema Notation (CSN)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/csn) file and parses the `entities`, `fields` and `types` that decleared inside the `schema.cds` file. 
Afterwards, generates csv files filled with `mock` or `random` data for each entity. 

Random strings come from `mock-data/mockStrings.json` file.

> ATTENTION: This early preview version does not support all data types and features of  [Definition Language (CDL)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl) yet.

## SWAPI App Demo
> INFO: The sample app that used in this demo is : [https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-hana-swapi](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-hana-swapi). This awesome and quite complex application is really good choice to try this extension.
